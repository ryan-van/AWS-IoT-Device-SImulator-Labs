# AWS-IoT-Device-Simulator-Labs

## Introduction
This is a series of labs to introduce users to AWS IoT Services. Instead of traditional labs utilizing AWS SDK for simulating data ingest, these labs focus on utilizing AWS's IoT Device Simulator. The Device Simulator uses a CloudFormation Template to setup a web interface for simple data ingest. Everything in these labs will be based solely off of AWS Services.  This simplifies usage for new customers getting acquainted with AWS and works with devices mostly through a GUI to help shift focus to IoT service
